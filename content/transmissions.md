# Transmissions

*"These are not performances. They are captures—moments when the veil grows thin and the forest's voice breaks through into frequencies humans can parse."*

Each transmission originates from a convergence event. Some flow from marathon sessions around sacred fires, others emerge from solo wanderings where the boundaries between self and wilderness dissolve. The videos themselves are collaborative visions, animated glimpses into the liminal spaces where our music is born.

## Recent Transmissions

*More transmissions will manifest as they are received...*

### Hearth Songs
*Folk/Acoustic • The gentler voices*

Transmissions that emerge in moments of quiet communion—dawn light through mist, conversations with ancient trees, the soft crackle of dying embers.

### Forge Songs  
*Metal/Heavy • The thunder from below*

When the earth speaks in anger and the Forge-Keeper channels lightning through amplified steel. These transmissions capture the raw power of storm systems and tectonic shifts.

### Spore Songs
*Psychedelic/Ambient • The mycelial frequencies*

Layered, evolving soundscapes that mirror the complex communications of the forest floor's fungal networks. Best experienced with headphones, in darkness, with eyes closed.
